This is theme color of the website and any web application. In this we care for the color combination used which is the ui interface of the web site.
The thing that I only need is to use the button that which change the entire color of the web site. Now, I know the way to do this. 
This is done by adding color file color.json or databse creation that store the parent color. 
color.json

{
  "color": "#355454"
  "status": "true/false"
} 
By using this we can change the color of whole site.
